### Overview: 
The objective of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties. The dataset used for this task contained features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol content, with wine quality rated on a scale (typically from 0 to 10, though the provided example appears to use binary labels 0 and 1).

### Conclusion: 
The Random Forest model for wine quality classification exhibited promising performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 81%. The balanced precision and recall scores suggest that the model is effective in distinguishing between low and high-quality wines based on chemical properties.
